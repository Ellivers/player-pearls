## Player Pearls

A Minecraft data pack that allows you to teleport other people through pearls. Even works with [The Creeper's Code](https://thecreeperscode.com/)'s Positional Anchor!

<br>

This project uses [PlayerDB](https://github.com/rx-modules/PlayerDB).

### Usage

Rename a pearl to "player pearl" (case sensitive) in an anvil, then put the resulting pearl in your inventory and look at its tooltip.
